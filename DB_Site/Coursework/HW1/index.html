				<h3>Article 1 - Google</h3>

				<p>“Another addition to Alphabet’s latest filing warns about software errors. "Bugs or defects in our products and services have occurred and may occur in the future, or our security measures could be breached, resulting in the improper use and/or disclosure of user data," the company wrote. Last year, Google found a software glitch in its Google Plus social network that could have exposed the personal data of as many as half a million people. The company decided to shut the service soon after.” This article addresses Google’s current data controversy. Google and other internet conglomerates such as Facebook receive massive amounts of data from consumers and users of their platforms. One issue facing these companies revolves around whether those giving over their data provided informed consent. However, another major and growing issue concerns the security of the data itself. Pooling the ever-growing ocean of data requires immense security of client information, security that either simply isn’t there or just isn’t good enough. While companies like Google argue that their collection of data is mainly used for harmless, individualized advertisement, those who steal consumer data may not have such polite intensions. Not adequately protecting data should be considered equivalent to mishandling of personal client information, and one can only assume that as the growing threat of “data leaks” rises, more and more of us will be less inclined to hand over our personal information.</p>

				<p>“Healthcare.gov found its records compromised, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services acknowledging an estimated 75,000 personal files were surreptitiously accessed this past October.” This article discusses the changes being made (or not) to the pharmaceutical industry in their attempts to protect their data. “Pharma and its partners have their eyes wide open to the threat posed by the potential mishandling of sensitive patient information. They’re also aware just how thin a line they’ve been walking over the years.” In truth, the Pharmaceutical and Insurance Industries have been often blamed, and often rightly so, for misusing data. There have been numerous scandals about the health industry unrightfully discriminating based on their data. For example, there was a time when gay/bisexual males were not allowed to donate blood if they had been sexually active within the year due to fear of the HIV virus. Proponents of the policy pointed to data that highlighted the demographics that were disproportionately affected by HIV, yet the policy's extremity cannot be overstated. The article points out that there is a “thirst” for more and more data, specifically in order to yield more accurate predictions. However, there is an issue regarding the careful management (or lack-there-of) of data, as pointed out by  Asaf Evenhaim, cofounder and CEO of pharma data/analytics supplier Crossix. “There’s no great way for industry to evaluate and hold solution providers accountable for how [data] is being used,” he says. The article continues to highlight the dynamic in which the health industry requires data in order to provide improved services while also requiring regulation to prevent malpractice and the blatant misuse of patient data.</p>

				<h3>Article 3 - Pew Research: 2020 Presidential Election></h3>

				<p>This article outlines several important changes and factors moving into the looming 2020 Presidential Race. Firstly, the article discusses the increasing importance of the minority vote. “While demographic changes unfold slowly, it’s already clear that the 2020 electorate will be unique in several ways. Nonwhites will account for a third of eligible voters – their largest share ever – driven by long-term increases among certain groups, especially Hispanics.” One can only assume that the importance of the Hispanic vote will result in the border-wall controversy being center-stage of the Democratic platform. Secondly, the article points out another unique aspect of this year’s election: age.  The article points out that, “one-in-ten eligible voters will be members of Generation Z,  the Americans who will be between the ages 18 and 23 next year. That will occur as Millennials and all other older generations account for a smaller share of eligible voters than they did in 2016,” as well as the declining voter share of the Baby Boomers.  The article also points out that,”It remains unclear how these patterns might factor into the 2020 election and, as always, a great deal will depend on who turns out to vote.” Based on this conclusion, I would predict that both parties will increasingly attempt to use emotional, rather than rational arguments, as that strategy has been linked to increased voter turnout. The data from this article was compiled from several locations. “Estimates for 2000-2016 are from Census Bureau microdata provided through IPUMS-USA. In 2000, the decennial census 5% sample was used. In all other years (2008, 2012 and 2016), the 1-year American Community Survey sample was used. Projections for 2020 were created using the Census Bureau’s 2017 National Population Projections as a base. Additional calculations used to create adjustments were made using Census Bureau vintage 2016 National Population Estimates for the U.S. resident population as of July 1, 2016. The article had to adjust the data for several key factors that distinguish this presidential race to previous ones, and points out several assumptions made, such as, “about naturalization trends to project naturalized foreign-born citizens eligible to vote.”</p>
